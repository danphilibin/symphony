# Review Agents

This folder will contain code-review agents tuned to Dan's criteria.

## Planned agents (not yet implemented)

- **taste-reviewer** – Checks for "AI slop" and enforces quality bar.
- **overbuild-detector** – Flags unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
- **subtle-bug-hunter** – Surfaces tricky bugs that are easy to miss.

TODO: Define actual agent specs here once review criteria are established.
