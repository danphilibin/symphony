# Research Agents

This folder will contain agents for codebase analysis, docs research, and external lookups.

## Planned agents (not yet implemented)

- **codebase-analyst** – Finds patterns and conventions in the current repo.
- **docs-fetcher** – Retrieves relevant framework/library documentation.

---

TODO: Define actual agent specs here once research needs are clearer.
